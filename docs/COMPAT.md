# Mod Compatibility Strategy

This document explains how Multi-Team Support (MTS) integrates with other mods, especially chunk-generation and surface-decorator mods that traditionally assume a single shared Nauvis. It's both a guide for **MTS admins** trying to make a third-party mod work on team surfaces, and a reference for **third-party mod authors** who want their mod to play well with MTS.

## The core problem

MTS gives every team its own copy of Nauvis (e.g. `team-3-nauvis` or, on Space Age, `mts-nauvis-3`). Mods that decorate Nauvis — dangOreus's ore flooding, VoidBlock's void terrain, terrain overhauls, resource modifiers — typically hook `on_chunk_generated` or `on_surface_created` and filter with:

```lua
if surface.name == "nauvis" then ... end
```

That filter rejects every team surface. The mod's logic only runs on the literal `"nauvis"` surface, which in MTS is usually unused or hidden.

There is no single trick that makes every such mod multi-surface aware. MTS uses three layers of strategy, ranked by how little work they require from third-party authors.

## Layer 1: Zero-cooperation — event replay

**Cost to other authors: nothing.** They don't need to know MTS exists.

When an admin installs a new chunk-gen mod on a save that already has team surfaces, the new mod's `on_init` runs but it never sees those surfaces. To trigger its setup retroactively, run:

```
/mts-replay
```

This re-fires `on_surface_created` (and the MTS-specific `on_team_surface_created`) for every existing team surface. To also re-fire `on_chunk_generated` for every existing chunk:

```
/mts-replay --chunks
```

`--chunks` is heavy (one event per chunk per surface) but is the right call if the new mod's logic lives in its `on_chunk_generated` handler.

### What replay can and cannot do

**Helps when** the mod's handler doesn't filter by hardcoded surface name — for example, mods keyed off `surface.planet`, off `map_gen_settings`, off prototypes, or off "any surface with biters". These act on whatever surface the event delivers.

**Does not help when** the mod's handler filters with `surface.name == "nauvis"`. The replayed event carries the real team surface, and `surface.name` is `"team-3-nauvis"`, not `"nauvis"`. There is no way to spoof `surface.name` from outside the mod — `LuaSurface` is not proxyable. For these mods you need Layer 2 or 3.

### When NOT to run replay

- **Right after a normal MTS-only update.** The mod ecosystem hasn't changed; replay would just double-fire handlers that already saw the surfaces. Reserve replay for "I just installed a new chunk-gen mod" situations.
- **If the new mod is already MTS-aware** (subscribes to `mts-v1`'s `on_team_surface_created`). Its setup is already running on every team surface; replay would double-apply it.
- **For mods whose setup is non-idempotent.** If their handler spawns entities or grants items per chunk, replay duplicates them. Test on a backup save first.

## Layer 2: Light cooperation — `mts-v1` remote interface

**Cost to other authors: ~5 lines of Lua. No source disclosure required.**

MTS exposes a public remote interface, `mts-v1`, with custom events and queries. Closed-source mod authors can subscribe without sharing code. The minimal integration:

```lua
script.on_init(function()
    if remote.interfaces["mts-v1"] then
        local id = remote.call("mts-v1", "get_event_id", "on_team_surface_created")
        script.on_event(id, function(event)
            -- event.surface_name, event.force_name
            local surface = game.surfaces[event.surface_name]
            my_mod.setup_surface(surface)  -- the function you already have
        end)
    end
end)
```

That's it. The mod author doesn't change their existing per-chunk or per-surface logic; they just register a second entry point that runs their existing setup function on each team surface.

The full event and query catalog lives in [`scripts/remote_api.lua`](../scripts/remote_api.lua). The interface name is versioned (`mts-v1`); breaking changes will ship as a parallel `mts-v2` rather than mutating v1.

## Layer 3: Upstream — `surface.planet.name`

**Cost to other authors: 2 lines of Lua. Doesn't even mention MTS.**

This is the right long-term fix and the easiest pitch to a closed-source mod author, because it is framed as a generic correctness improvement rather than an MTS-specific accommodation.

Most chunk-gen mods filter their `on_chunk_generated` handler with:

```lua
if surface.name == "nauvis" then ... end
```

This is wrong even without MTS. In Factorio 2.0 with Space Age, modded planets ("Maraxsis", "Muluna", etc.) have surfaces whose `surface.name` is *not* `"nauvis"` but whose `surface.planet.name` is. The filter should be:

```lua
if surface.planet and surface.planet.name == "nauvis" then ... end
```

This is correct for vanilla Nauvis, correct for modded planets, correct for space platforms (whose `planet` is `nil`), and **correct for MTS team surfaces**, because each team's Nauvis variant carries `planet="nauvis"`. No MTS-specific code needed.

When pitching this change to a third-party author, frame it as: *"Your mod targets the Nauvis planet, not specifically the surface called 'nauvis'. Filtering by `surface.planet.name` makes the mod compatible with planet mods generally."* MTS compatibility is a free side effect.

## Strategy summary

| Layer | Tool                          | Cost to other author | Works for surface-name filters? |
| :---- | :---------------------------- | :------------------- | :------------------------------ |
| 1     | `/mts-replay` event replay    | Nothing              | No                              |
| 2     | `mts-v1` remote interface     | ~5 lines             | Yes                             |
| 3     | `surface.planet.name` upstream | ~2 lines             | Yes                             |

The layers stack. Run replay to catch what it can, file an upstream PR or feature request for what it can't, and document the remaining gaps.

## What MTS will *not* do

- **Reverse-engineer or monkey-patch closed-source mods.** The pattern is fragile, version-coupled, and breaks silently when the upstream mod updates. We use it nowhere in the codebase.
- **Spoof `surface.name`.** It's not technically possible, and even if it were, it would lie to every other mod on the server.
- **Bundle compat shims for arbitrary chunk-gen mods.** The repo currently carries shims for [`compat/dangoreus.lua`](../compat/dangoreus.lua) and [`compat/voidblock.lua`](../compat/voidblock.lua) because those mods are widely used and don't yet support multi-surface. Each shim is tracked as technical debt; the long-term plan is to delete them as upstream support lands.

## Reporting compat issues

If you maintain a chunk-gen or surface-modifying mod and want to integrate cleanly with MTS, open an issue at https://github.com/bits-orio/multi-team-support/issues and we'll help you pick the right layer. If you're an admin trying to make a specific combo work, the same applies — a brief description of what doesn't work plus the mod combo is enough to triage.
