-- events/player_removed.lua
-- Handle permanent player removal (on_pre_player_removed) — e.g. an admin
-- running game.remove_offline_players() or /purge-player.
--
-- "Removed" is NOT "left" (disconnect): a removed player_index is orphaned in
-- every player-index-keyed storage table, in team_leader, and in cross-player
-- GUIs (a member's Accept/Reject dialog). Removed indexes can be reused, so a
-- new player inheriting a stale index would inherit the old player's state.
--
-- on_pre_player_removed fires BEFORE the engine deletes the player, so
-- game.get_player(index) is still valid here — the handler can read player.force
-- and run team_slots.remove_from_team (leader promotion / solo-disband). The
-- post-deletion on_player_removed can't, so it isn't used.
