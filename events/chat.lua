-- events/chat.lua
-- Channel-aware cross-force chat routing with spectator prefix tagging.
--
-- The engine delivers every chat message to the sender's CURRENT force before
-- any mod runs — that native delivery IS team chat, and no mod can cancel or
-- edit it. This handler adds everything else:
--   global channel (default): relay to every other force + bridge emit.
--   team-only channel: nothing to add — unless the sender is force-swapped
--     spectating, where the native copy went to the spectator force instead
--     of their team; the team copy is relayed here, tagged [spectating]. The
--     native copy remains visible to co-spectators (engine-imposed; disclosed
--     to the sender on entering spectate and via a soft sound per message).
--
-- MTS disables the bridge's baseline chat capture (remote_api.register_with_
-- bridge), so Discord only ever receives what this file explicitly emits:
-- global-channel messages, shouts, spectator/server chatter. Team-only
-- messages never leave the game.
