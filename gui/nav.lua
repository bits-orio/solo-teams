-- Thin wrapper around player.gui.top that provides a shared top-bar button
-- strip and a central click-handler registry.  Every GUI module registers its
-- own button and handler here.
-- NOTE: mod_gui was removed in Factorio 2.x; we use player.gui.top directly.

local nav = {}

-- name → function(event) registry, populated at module load time via nav.on_click.
local handlers = {}

-- The ordered button list lives in storage.nav_button_order (array of
-- { name, sprite, tooltip } in registration order), NOT a module-local: a peer
-- that loads a save whose gui.top already holds the buttons must compute the same
-- insert index as the host. A module-local reset to {} on that peer's load, so
-- position_after_mts returned a divergent index -> gui.top child order (a
-- checksummed part of MP state) differed across peers -> desync.
