-- An admin-editable info panel in the dead center of the landing pen. The host
-- edits its text from the Admin panel's "Run Info" tab to describe each run
-- (mods, goals, rules) so players landing in know what they're playing.
--
-- Built on the base-game display-panel entity (present with OR without Space
-- Age), pre-configured with the info icon and both visibility toggles, and left
-- NON-OPERABLE so it is display-only: clicking it opens nothing. All editing goes
-- through the Admin GUI via a script write, which sidesteps the pen's spectator
-- permission group (scripts/spectator/core.lua) -- that group blocks the
-- edit_display_panel_* input actions for everyone, admins included, so the native
-- panel GUI can't be used. Writing display_panel_text from a script needs no
-- input action, so no permission-group or force change is required.
--
-- Also charts the small pen area for every force, so the island + panel stay
-- visible on the map even for a player who spawned onto their team surface before
-- the pen finished charting (otherwise the pen reads as a black island when they
-- look back at it).
