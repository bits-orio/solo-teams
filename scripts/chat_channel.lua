-- Chat privacy channel: "global" (default) or "local" (team-only).
--
-- SCOPE. The admin flag individual_chat_enabled decides who one switch moves:
--   team scope (default) — the whole TEAM moves together. Syncing per team
--     removes the asymmetric-conversation leak where one member asks in
--     team-only mode and a teammate still in global mode answers for the
--     whole server to read.
--   individual scope — each PLAYER carries their own channel. That leak comes
--     back by construction, which is why it stayed off until the chat badge
--     (scripts/chat_tag.lua) put each message's channel in the line itself: a
--     teammate can now see they are about to answer in the open.
--
-- Each scope keeps its own storage. A team's setting survives a round trip;
-- the per-player table is re-seeded from it on every flip to individual, so
-- an individual choice does not outlive an admin flipping scope back and
-- forth. Flips migrate in the privacy-preserving direction only — see
-- M.on_scope_change.
--
-- The engine's native chat delivery (sender's force only) IS team chat; the
-- channel only decides whether events/chat.lua relays a message beyond it.
-- Pen spectators are always global — no state, no toggle. A team-only member
-- can shout one message globally by starting it with "!".
--
-- Requires helpers and admin_flags, both of which are themselves leaves, so
-- spectator core, the HUD, and the chat event handler can all require this
-- without closing a cycle.
--
-- Storage shape (absent = global, the default, in both):
--   storage.chat_channel[force_name]          = "local"   -- team scope
--   storage.chat_channel_player[player_index] = "local"   -- individual scope

-- one constant retunes all of them.

--- Carry channel state across a scope flip, in the privacy-preserving
