-- create / retire an EPHEMERAL, caller-seeded surface for a team, for the
-- mts-v1 API (warp-style consumers like MTS Dimension Warp).
--
-- Create path: the caller supplies the full map_gen_settings (including a
-- deterministic per-warp seed) and a NON-VARIANT name (must NOT match
-- mts-<planet>-N or team-N-<planet>, so normalize_variant_seed leaves the
-- caller's seed intact). We register force<->surface ownership, then
-- game.create_surface with the caller's settings. The engine then fires
-- on_surface_created, whose handler (events/ticks.lua) runs the existing flow
-- — normalize (skips it, non-variant) -> visibility -> spawn_labels.draw ->
-- raise_team_surface_created — against the ownership we registered first. Works
-- with or without Space Age (game.create_surface needs no planet).
--
-- Retire path: delete ONLY the named surface and unwind only its bookkeeping
-- (map entries + player_surfaces). It must NOT use cleanup_force_surfaces, which
-- deletes the WHOLE force's surfaces -- during a warp the team also owns the
-- just-created destination surface, which that would wrongly wipe. No event is
-- raised, so setup/teardown stay a predictable matched pair.

-- No cycle now: remote_api injects this module (set_deferred_deps) rather than
-- requiring it, so team_surfaces -> surface_utils is a one-way edge.
