-- Implements the mts-v1 `disband_team` action. It lives in its own module so it
-- can require both team_slots and landing_pen (which together would form a
-- circular require with remote_api) and inject the implementation back into
-- remote_api. Nothing else requires this module, so it's a safe leaf.

local team_slots  = require("scripts.team_slots")
local landing_pen = require("gui.landing_pen")
local spectator   = require("scripts.spectator")
local remote_api  = require("scripts.remote_api")
local helpers     = require("scripts.helpers")

--- Disband a team entirely: every member back to the pen, slot freed, surfaces
--- cleaned up. Reuses the normal leave flow (remove_from_team disbands + cleans
--- up on the last member removed; return_to_pen relocates each player).
local function disband(force_name)
    if type(force_name) ~= "string" or not force_name:match("^team%-%d+$") then return end
    local force = game.forces[force_name]
    if not (force and force.valid) then return end

    -- Occupancy guard: every team-N force is pre-created and never destroyed, so
    -- game.forces[force_name] is valid even for a slot that was never claimed.
    -- Without this, disband_team on an unoccupied slot runs cleanup + release and
    -- raises a spurious on_team_released (with no matching on_team_created), and a
    -- consumer that defensively re-calls disband_team from its on_team_released
    -- handler would recurse until the Lua stack overflows. An occupied-but-empty
    -- slot (members force-moved away) still passes and is handled below.
    local slot = helpers.team_slot(force_name)
    if (storage.team_pool or {})[slot] ~= "occupied" then return end

    -- Restore any member currently spectating away (so they enter the members
    -- list below and are returned to the pen, not orphaned) and exit outside
    -- viewers of this team before it is torn down.
