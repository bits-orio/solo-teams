-- ─── Build Mappings ──────────────────────────────────────────────────

--- Build the force↔planet bidirectional maps based on team_pool slots.
--- Call on_init (after create_team_pool) and on_configuration_changed.
--- Idempotent: rebuilds from scratch each call.
---
--- Iteration uses space_age.list_base_planets_runtime(), which reads
--- game.planets directly. This means:
---   • Vanilla planets (nauvis, vulcanus, gleba, fulgora, aquilo)
---     are picked up.
---   • Modded planets (Lignumis, Maraxsis, Muluna, etc.) registered by
---     any mod path — data:extend, PlanetsLib:extend, etc. — are also
---     picked up.
---   • If a player adds a planet mod to an existing save,
---     on_configuration_changed re-runs build() and the new modded
---     planet appears in the map automatically.
---   • Variants for the new planet have already been created at data
---     stage by prototypes/planets.lua (which uses the parallel
---     list_base_planets_data() iterator), so the runtime lookup
---     always finds them.

--- Hide + lock vanilla base planets for a team force. Safe to call at any

--- research the team has already completed.
---
--- Reasons to call this:
---   - Space Age lazily creates a base planet's surface when something
---     first touches it. We re-hide on on_surface_created so the newly-
---     created surface stays invisible to teams.
---   - Defensive top-up: base planets should always be locked for teams.

    -- Note: hiding in Platformer mode used to trigger a Factorio SurfaceList
    -- engine quirk that dumped god-mode players onto the landing-pen after
    -- escaping a remote view. That's now mitigated by the god_pre_remote

---   - on_force_reset / on_technology_effects_reset (engine wiped research)

--- change (e.g. a mod update). Those preserve research yet make the engine
--- re-point each discovery tech's unlock at the BASE planet, while the
--- redirect that unlocks the team's VARIANT only ever runs on
--- on_research_finished. So without this, a team that researched and reached
--- (say) Vulcanus loses its variant unlock on the next reset — the planet
--- relocks and goes dark — until manually unlocked.
---
--- Calling this after apply_force_locks restores the variant unlocks from the
--- researched discovery techs (re-running the on_research_finished redirect for
--- every already-completed one). Safe in every context: if research was wiped,
--- no discovery tech is researched and this is a no-op, so it never resurrects
--- a previous slot occupant's planets on recycle.

--- Get or create the surface for a planet by name. Returns nil on failure.

--- on that chunk, which overwrites destination contents — including
--- any character entity present in the destination. If chunk
--- generation is deferred (queued via request_to_generate_chunks but
--- not forced), the player teleports onto an ungenerated chunk,
--- Factorio auto-generates it under their feet, clone_mirror
--- destroys their character, and the player drops into god mode.
---
--- force_generate_chunk_requests blocks until all queued chunks
--- generate. By the time we return, clone_mirror has run on every
--- chunk in the spawn area; the player teleports onto already-cloned
--- terrain and their character survives.
---
--- Mirrors the same fix in compat/vanilla.lua's setup_player_surface.

-- ─── Discovery Tech Hook ─────────────────────────────────────────────
--
-- A "discovery tech" is any technology whose effect list contains an
-- `unlock-space-location` modifier. Researching it normally unlocks
-- the linked space location (e.g. vulcanus). For team forces we
-- redirect that unlock to the team's *variant* of that location so
-- discovery research never reveals the shared base planet — only the
-- team's private copy.
--
-- We detect discovery techs by inspecting the technology prototype's
-- effects rather than matching on name, because:
--   • Vanilla uses "planet-discovery-{vulcanus,gleba,fulgora,aquilo}".
--   • Modded planets often follow the same naming convention but not
--     always (Lignumis uses "planet-discovery-lignumis", Maraxsis
--     might use a different scheme, etc.).
--   • Some modpacks rename existing techs.
--
-- Looking at effects directly is robust against any naming.

--- Build the discovery-tech map at runtime by scanning every technology
--- for an unlock-space-location effect. Cached in storage and rebuilt
--- on configuration changes.
---
--- Returns: { [tech_name] = base_planet_name, ... }

-- ─── Logistic Request Rewrite ────────────────────────────────────────
--
-- The hub's "Import from" planet picker can't be filtered per-force in
-- Factorio 2.x: lock_space_location only gates schedule destinations,
-- and SpaceLocationPrototype.hidden is a global prototype flag. So
-- every team's hub still lists every planet variant (and every base
-- planet) in the dropdown. Reactive correction: when a player edits a
-- team-owned space-platform request, rewrite the slot's import_from
-- to the team's own variant of the same base planet.
--
-- import_from is only meaningful for space-platform requests. A ground
-- logistic chest can still carry the field — it rides along when a
-- request section is copied from a hub via blueprint, paste-settings,
-- or a shared logistic group — but on a planet surface it's inert
-- residue. Rewriting it there does nothing except spam the player
-- (and, through logistic-group propagation, once per group member),
-- so we gate on the entity being on a space platform before touching it.
--
-- Event payload (2.0.76):
--   entity (LuaEntity), section (LuaLogisticSection), slot_index (uint),
--   player_index (uint, optional — nil when scripted).
--
-- import_from may arrive as a string, a {name = "..."} table, or a
-- LuaSpaceLocationPrototype userdata — all three reduce to the name.
