-- Per-item scope for the starter-items list.
--
--   player  every member who spawns gets their own copy
--   team    granted ONCE, to whichever member of a team spawns first
--
-- Why this exists: the pen grant runs per player, so a two-person team used to
-- receive two full copies of the map's starting kit and raced a solo team with
-- double the resources. Personal equipment (armor, gun, a mod's construction
-- robots) is meant to be per-player; bulk resources are not. Scope lives on each
-- entry, so the split is data an admin can edit rather than a hardcoded list.
--
-- Absent scope reads as "player", so saves written before this existed -- and
-- rows an admin adds by hand -- keep the previous behaviour until someone says
-- otherwise.
--
-- Storage:
--   storage.team_kit_granted[force_name] = true  -- team already took its one kit

--- True when this entry is granted once per team rather than per player.
function starter_scope.is_team(item)

--- Normalised scope of an entry: anything that isn't TEAM is player-scoped.
function starter_scope.of(item)
    return starter_scope.is_team(item) and starter_scope.TEAM or starter_scope.PLAYER
end

--- Flip one entry between the two scopes. Player scope is stored as nil rather
--- than the string so the common case adds nothing to the save.

--- Forget that a team took its kit. Called from team_slots.wipe_slot_state, so a
--- recycled team-N slot hands the next team to occupy it their own copy instead
--- of inheriting the previous occupant's "already paid" mark.

--- Seed scopes on a freshly captured list. A compat module that knows which of
--- its mod's items are bulk map resources claims them here; whatever no module
--- claims stays player-scoped.
---
--- Only ever called where the list is being (re)built from a character -- the
--- auto-capture and the admin's "copy from my inventory" -- so it never fights an
--- admin's per-row edits, which are made against an already-seeded list.
