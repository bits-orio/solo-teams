-- Multi-Team Support - scripts/remote_api.lua
-- Author: bits-orio

--
-- Public remote interface ("mts-v1") + custom events for third-party mods
-- that need to integrate with multi-team-support (e.g. chunk-gen mods like
-- dangOreus, VoidBlock that need to know about team surfaces).
--
-- Stability contract: the interface name "mts-v1" and every function /
-- event listed below is frozen for the v1 lifetime. Adding new
-- functions/events is safe; renaming/removing is not. When breaking
-- changes are needed, register a new "mts-v2" interface alongside.
--
-- ─── Subscribing as a third-party mod ─────────────────────────────────
--
--   -- in your control.lua, AFTER on_init/on_load have run:
--   if remote.interfaces["mts-v1"] then
--       local id = remote.call("mts-v1", "get_event_id", "on_team_surface_created")
--       script.on_event(id, function(event)
--           -- event.surface_name, event.force_name
--       end)
--   end
--
-- ─── Querying state ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
--
--   if remote.interfaces["mts-v1"] then
--       local owner = remote.call("mts-v1", "get_surface_owner", "team-3-nauvis")
--       -- → "team-3" or nil
--   end

-- mid-game (or any reload) can't remote.call in on_load to re-register, so a
