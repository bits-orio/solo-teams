-- The team pause freeze: disable every power SOURCE the team owns.
--
-- Why kill sources instead of machines or wires
-- ─────────────────────────────────────────────
-- Setting active=false on every machine (the retired force_pause approach) is
-- buggy mid-operation and the bugs are endless; an unpowered machine instead
-- keeps its state and simply idles, so resume is clean by construction. Cutting
-- pole-to-pole wires (scripts/pause/wires.lua) is NOT a freeze either: a local
-- substation fed by a local generator stays an island and powers its whole
-- supply area regardless of which trunk wires were cut. The only airtight
-- freeze is to kill the SOURCES themselves, immediately, across every owned
-- surface. That is this module's single job.
--
-- This is event-driven: pause/control.lua calls freeze()/thaw() directly at the
-- moment of the pause/resume decision. No tick polling, no dirty flag.
--
-- ✓ RESOLVED — accumulator charge under active=false
-- ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- The spike is resolved: active=false does NOT stop an accumulator from
-- DISCHARGING its stored charge into the network, so a paused base with charged
-- accumulators keeps running off them (reported in-game: a docked base's
-- assembler still had power). active=false also doesn't drain the charge (an
-- earlier headless spike confirmed it persists). So we now SNAPSHOT each
-- accumulator's energy, zero it on freeze (no stored power to discharge), and
-- RESTORE it on thaw -- the snapshot+restore the comment used to call for.

local power = {}

-- Diagnostic logging. Off by default; flip to true to trace what the freeze
-- disables (per type) in factorio-current.log ([mts:pause/power:DIAG]).
local DIAG = false
local function diag(msg)
    if DIAG then log("[mts:pause/power:DIAG] " .. msg) end
end

-- Entity TYPES that GENERATE or STORE electricity. Disabling active on these
-- stops the supply at the root. Verified as real Factorio 2.0 entity-type
-- strings (used as find_entities_filtered{type=...} filters; the array form is
-- grounded in dimension-warp/scripts/misc.lua and IR3 control-terrain.lua).
--
-- ⚠ KNOWN FREEZE LEAK — burner-fuelled machines.
-- A burner-generator with fuel already loaded, and more broadly any burner
-- machine (burner mining drill, stone furnace, boiler+steam-engine chain that
-- is mid-burn) keeps consuming its currently-loaded fuel item for one more
-- "burn" even with active=false in some engine versions, because the fuel
-- inventory is independent of the active flag. We disable burner-generator
-- here, but a fully airtight burner freeze would also need to clear/snapshot
-- the fuel/burner inventories — deliberately out of scope for v1; comment kept
-- so the leak is discoverable.
