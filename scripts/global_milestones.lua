-- Server-wide "first ever" celebrations: first rocket launched and first
-- landing on each planet. Each flag fires at most once per save, and the
-- announcement is broadcast to every player + drawn on every screen via
-- pop_text.global_milestone.
--
-- LuaSurface.planet.name identifies the planet, but each per-team variant
-- is its own planet prototype (mts-vulcanus-1, mts-vulcanus-2, ...), so the
-- name is normalized back to its canonical base ("vulcanus") via
-- space_age.parse_variant. Without this every team's variant counts as a
-- distinct planet and the "first landing" celebration fires once per team
-- instead of once per save. Modded planets (any prototype registered as a
-- planet) are detected automatically and normalized the same way.

-- ─── First rocket launched ────────────────────────────────────────────

-- Late-game teams launch rockets continuously (tens of thousands of launches),
-- which would flood the Discord bridge. The announcement cadence WIDENS in tiers
-- as the running total grows, so the number of posts per tier stays bounded no
-- matter how big the base gets:
--
--   total ≤ 10     every launch      (10 posts)
--   total ≤ 100    one per 5         (18 posts: 15, 20, … 100)
--   total ≤ 500    one per 25        (16 posts: 125, 150, … 500)
--   total ≤ 1000   one per 50        (10 posts: 550, 600, … 1000)
--   total > 1000   one per 100       (terminal cadence, forever)
--
-- So a 45k-launch megabase posts once every ~100 rockets, not the old every-25.
-- Each tier is ~10–18 posts, then a flat 1-per-100 — the feed never speeds up
-- again past 1000 launches.

-- Report the HIGHEST step-multiple the counter has reached that hasn't been
-- announced yet, rather than testing `total % step == 0`. Two engine realities:
--   • force.rockets_launched skips and duplicates values when several rockets
--     resolve close together (live logs show "...30254, 30254, 30256..."), so a
--     plain exact-multiple test goes silent when the multiple is skipped and
--     double-posts when a duplicate lands on one.
--   • the announced number should read cleanly, not as a raw overshoot (…45301).
-- floor(total/step)*step is the highest multiple the counter has reached; report
-- it whenever it exceeds the last reported mark. The feed never goes silent,
-- never double-posts, and every announced number past 10 is a step multiple
-- (…45300, 45400) — always ending in 0 or 5. Deriving the mark from the CURRENT
-- total (not last+step) also means a fresh install / counter reset on an already-
-- huge force jumps straight to the current neighbourhood instead of crawling up
-- from a low number. A tier boundary widens the step, so the next mark lands on
-- the wider grid (after 100 the next is 125, after 1000 it's 1100).
