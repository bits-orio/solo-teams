--- Find a player's home surface, preferring their actual primary

---
--- Lookup order:
---   1. storage.player_surfaces[player_index]: the surface the player
---      spawned on. This is their canonical home for vanilla, voidblock,
---      Space Age (mts-nauvis-N), and Platformer (platform-N) — every
---      mode populates this entry during setup_player_surface.
---   2. Space Age home planet variant via map_force_to_planets: covers
---      buddies who joined an existing team and don't have their own
---      player_surfaces entry but should land on the team's nauvis
---      variant.
---   3. Surface-name search for any surface owned by this force: another
---      buddy fallback for non-Space-Age modes.
---   4. Any space platform owned by the force: last-resort fallback for
---      the rare case where a team has launched a platform but somehow
---      has no other surface (e.g. all planet surfaces deleted, or a
---      legacy save state we didn't anticipate).
---
--- Why platforms are now last
--- ──────────────────────────
--- Earlier versions returned a space platform first if any existed.
--- That made sense for Platformer mode (where the platform IS the
--- primary base) but broke for Space Age: any team that had ever
--- launched a rocket would have "return to base" send the player to
--- the platform instead of their planet. The Platformer case is still
--- handled correctly by step 1, because Platformer's setup_player_surface
--- populates player_surfaces with the platform's surface name.
