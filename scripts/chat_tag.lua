-- Per-message channel badge, stamped onto player.tag.
--
-- The engine prints every chat message to the sender's own force before any
-- mod runs, and that native line cannot be cancelled or edited (see
-- events/chat.lua). player.tag is the only handle on it: the engine appends
-- the tag after the player's name, so the badge rides along on the one line
-- MTS otherwise cannot touch. That makes chat scrollback a record of the
-- channel each message was sent under — something the HUD switch, which only
-- ever shows the CURRENT state, cannot provide.
--
-- Both states carry a badge. Marking only one would make absence meaningful,
-- and absence is ambiguous: a fresh join, a pen spectator and an admin-moved
-- player all look identical to a team gone dark.
--
-- The tag is also drawn on the map and above multiplayer selection
-- rectangles, i.e. opposing teams can read it. That is accepted: a team-only
-- badge does tell opponents this team went dark, but the alternative leaks the
-- same fact through the badge's absence.
--
-- One case the badge cannot narrow: a "!" shout goes server-wide without
-- changing the channel, so that line still reads [TEAM]. The leading "!" the
-- sender typed is right there on the same line and is the marker for it —
-- nothing per-message can be stamped after the engine has already printed.

-- count-font is the only vanilla font that both fits the width budget and
-- sets border = true (size 13, from default-bold). The black outline is what
-- keeps the badge readable over arbitrary terrain in the map view, where an
-- unbordered tag washes out; the dark chat panel would not need it.
