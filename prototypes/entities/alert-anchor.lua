-- A hidden, inert per-team anchor entity for force alerts. 2.1's
-- LuaForce::add_custom_alert needs an entity to point at, and stock MTS has no
-- guaranteed per-team entity (the passive radar exists only when consumer mods
-- request one). Placed lazily by scripts/pause/notify.lua at the team's spawn
-- immediately before an alert is raised, and NEVER trusted to survive:
-- consumer mods script-kill entities (cave-collapse die() bypasses both
-- destructible=false and protected) and retire surfaces, so it is re-ensured
-- on every use and simply dies with its surface. Deliberately NOT
-- Space-Age-gated -- alerts are base API.
