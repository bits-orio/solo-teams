-- A hidden, powerless passive radar that other MTS-aware mods place (via the
-- mts-v1 `ensure_passive_radar` interface) to keep a team surface live-viewable
-- when nobody is standing on it.
--
-- WHY this exists: a remote/map view only renders chunks that are CHARTED and
-- fog-free for the viewing force. An empty team surface has no standing vision
-- source, so a spectator (a chart-sharing friend of the team) sees a black
-- screen. A character provides live vision; so does a radar. We want a radar's
-- reveal WITHOUT a real radar's power cost or unbounded map charting.
--
-- The Factorio radar prototype has two reveal mechanisms:
--   max_distance_of_nearby_sector_revealed = a ring kept revealed while working.
--   max_distance_of_sector_revealed        = a rotating scan that charts sector
--       by sector out to this radius.
-- The save-bloat hazard is a LARGE sector radius (e.g. vanilla 14) that charts
-- the whole explored map over time. We bound BOTH to the same small radius, so
-- the radar only ever reveals/charts a fixed local bubble around itself -- enough
-- to make the floor viewable, but it never expands to chart the wider map (no
-- unbounded save growth). We deliberately keep the sector scan ON (not 0): a
-- nearby-only reveal proved unreliable in practice, and a bounded sector scan
-- guarantees the floor is actually revealed. Powered from a `void` source so it
-- needs no electricity and never shows in the power graph. Reused by MDW
-- (dimension floors / docks) and BNM. Consumers place several across a base
-- larger than one bubble.

-- Free power, no emissions: a hidden utility radar must not aggravate biters or

-- Reveal a BOUNDED local bubble: an always-revealed nearby ring PLUS a sector scan
