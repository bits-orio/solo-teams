-- Data-stage: creates per-team planet variants by deep-copying every base
-- planet prototype currently in `data.raw.planet`, N times, where
-- N = mts_max_teams startup setting.
--
-- Each variant is a full planet prototype with:
--   • unique name: "mts-<base>-<slot>" e.g. "mts-nauvis-1"
--   • the base planet's own map_seed_offset (kept from the deepcopy), so
--     every team's variant generates identical terrain — including
--     territory demolishers, which clone_mirror can't replicate
--   • orientation offset so they don't overlap visually in the solar
--     system view
--
-- Why iterate `data.raw.planet` instead of a hardcoded list
-- ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- Hardcoding {nauvis, vulcanus, gleba, fulgora, aquilo} excluded modded
-- planets (Maraxsis, Lignumis, Muluna, etc.) from variant creation —
-- teams would all share the modded planet, defeating the per-team
-- isolation MTS provides. Iterating the live prototype table picks up
-- every planet the mod stack has registered by data-final-fixes.
--
-- Load-order requirement: any mod (or planet library) that registers
-- planets must do so by data-final-fixes. Mods that depend on
-- PlanetsLib already follow this pattern. To guarantee MTS sees them,
-- info.json declares `? PlanetsLib` and similar libraries as optional
-- dependencies — Factorio resolves optional deps to "load before" so
-- their data stages complete before MTS iterates here.
--
-- The base planets themselves are left intact; they are locked for
-- team forces at runtime so teams can only see/reach their own
-- variants. See scripts/planet_map.lua's apply_force_locks.

-- ring purely by slot index, which is fine in practice (tested with
-- a few modded-planet combos at 20 teams; no visible overlap).
