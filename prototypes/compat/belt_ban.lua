-- Data-stage compat shim for the "belt-ban" mod (No Belts - Challenge Mode).
--
-- belt-ban disables the logistics / logistics-2 / logistics-3 technologies
-- (enabled = false) to strip out every transport belt. A disabled prerequisite
-- can never be satisfied, so that permanently orphans three important NON-belt
-- technologies that list logistics-2 as a prerequisite:
--
--   * automobilism   (car)
--   * bulk-inserter  (bulk inserter + capacity bonus)
--   * railway        (rails, locomotive, wagons)
--
-- We remove "logistics-2" from those three techs' prerequisites so they
-- reconnect to the tree through their OTHER prerequisites (engine /
-- fast-inserter / advanced-circuit), all of which stay researchable. Belts
-- themselves remain banned: we never touch logistics-2's own enabled flag.
--
-- Order relative to belt-ban does not matter -- belt-ban never edits these
-- three techs' prerequisites, so stripping logistics-2 here is independent of
-- whichever mod's data-final-fixes runs first.

-- tech name -> prerequisite to strip
