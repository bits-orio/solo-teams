-- Space Age integration: per-team planet variants and space connections.
-- Loaded at data-final-fixes so we see all base planets/connections from
-- any other mods.
--
-- When Space Age is not present, these files short-circuit (no planets to
-- deep-copy), and the mod falls back to the default surface-cloning behavior.

-- belt-ban compat: reconnect the non-belt techs (automobilism, bulk-inserter,
-- railway) that belt-ban orphans by disabling logistics-2. Independent of
-- Space Age, so it runs before the space-age guard below.
if mods["belt-ban"] then
    require("prototypes.compat.belt_ban")
end

-- Sea Block compat: repair the eight recipes that require bob-nickel-plate, which
-- nothing in the pack can produce. TEMPORARY -- delete once Sea Block Continued
-- ships the upstream fix (see the file header).
if mods["SeaBlockContinued"] then
    require("prototypes.compat.seablock_nickel")
end

-- Passivize radars (drop their map-charting sector scan, keep local reveal) so
-- 20 teams' radars don't bloat the save. Independent of Space Age; self-gates
-- on the mts_passive_radars startup setting. Runs here to catch mod radars too.
