-- Generic terrain compatibility for any third-party mod that decorates
-- the real "nauvis" surface via on_chunk_generated and filters by
-- hardcoded surface name. When a chunk is generated on a team-N-nauvis
-- (or mts-nauvis-N) surface, this module:
--
--   1. Ensures the same chunk has been generated on real nauvis. That
--      synchronously fires every third-party mod's on_chunk_generated
--      handler (dangOreus, VoidBlock, Alien Biomes' autoplace, etc.)
--      against the nauvis surface, where their filters DO accept it.
--   2. Mirrors the resulting tiles + entities + decoratives from
--      nauvis to the team surface via clone_area.
--
-- Net effect: whatever the mod stack puts on nauvis, every team
-- surface gets the same. Per-team variety is traded for "same map
-- across teams", which suits the head-to-head race format MTS targets.
--
-- This handler is mod-agnostic. Adding a new terrain decorator does
-- not require any per-mod compat code on the MTS side as long as the
-- mod's logic ends up writing to nauvis. Per-mod shims are only
-- needed for runtime gameplay rules that fire AFTER chunk generation
-- (e.g. dangOreus's on_built_entity, on_entity_died, on_nth_tick) and
-- those tend to be small and stable.
--
-- Cost model: marginal cost per team chunk approaches 1× as the team
-- count grows, because nauvis is generated once per chunk-area and
-- amortized across all teams. The first team to explore a chunk pays
-- ~2×; subsequent teams exploring the same chunk pay ~1×.

-- Mods whose generated chunks carry script-managed entities that clone_area
-- cannot safely replicate. For these MTS must NOT clone team surfaces — each
-- variant generates natively from its pinned per-base seed instead (see
-- surface_utils.normalize_variant_seed), which keeps terrain identical across
-- teams while leaving the mod's own per-surface generation and state intact:
--   • space-is-fake — demolisher territories on Nauvis; clone_area drops
--     segmented units (demolishers), so cloning wipes them.
--   • gridlocked    — per-chunk "gl-unclaimed-chunk" markers whose render data
--     is keyed by entity unit_number; cloning leaves an unregistered copy and
--     crashes its on_chunk_charted handler.
-- Auto-detected (no user-facing setting). Outer planets are already native, so
-- in practice this only switches Nauvis to native. Mutually exclusive with
-- surface-name-filtering Nauvis terrain mods (VoidBlock, dangOreus), which need
-- cloning to reach the variants.

--- Identify a team-owned planet variant and return the source planet
--- name to clone from, or nil if the surface is not a team variant.
---
--- Two naming schemes are recognized:
---   • "mts-<planet>-<N>"     — Space Age per-team variant
---   • "team-<N>-<planet>"    — base 2.0 cloned surface (no Space Age)
---
--- The captured planet name is returned verbatim and is used as the
--- key into `game.surfaces` to find the source. This works for any
--- planet — vanilla (nauvis, vulcanus, etc.) and modded (lignumis,
--- maraxsis, muluna, etc.). The patterns deliberately accept any
--- non-empty planet name, so a planet mod registered through any
--- path (data:extend, PlanetsLib:extend, etc.) cascades through the
--- variant naming and lands here automatically.

    return nil
end

--- Hook from MTS's on_chunk_generated event. Cheap when the surface
--- isn't a team variant (early return). For team variants, drives the
--- matching planet's chunk to generate and clones the result.
---
--- Generalisation note: this used to be hardcoded to nauvis only. The
--- generalization to all planets means a chunk-decorating mod that
--- targets, say, Vulcanus (filtering by `surface.name == "vulcanus"`)
--- will see its decoration mirrored to every team's Vulcanus variant
--- with no per-mod compat code. dangOreus, VoidBlock, Alien Biomes,
--- and (vanilla) modded resource autoplaces all benefit equally.
