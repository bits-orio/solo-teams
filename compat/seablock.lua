-- Sea Block hands EVERY player a full bulk kit (2000 landfill, 1200 iron plate,
-- solar panels, ...) from its own on_player_created. Under MTS that means a
-- two-person team starts with two copies of it and races a solo team with double
-- the resources.
--
-- Sea Block's own single-player path already treats that kit as a once-per-map
-- thing -- it goes into a rock chest at the starting point instead of into an
-- inventory, and any one player can mine it. Marking those items team-scoped
-- here restores that intent for multiplayer rather than inventing a new rule.
--
-- The kit is read from Sea Block's public remote interface rather than
-- hardcoded: it varies with startup settings (wind turbines vs solar panels +
-- accumulators, the LandfillPainting landfill variant) and with which of Bob's
-- and Angel's mods are present.
--
-- Only what Sea Block itself hands out is claimed. Anything else in the captured
-- loadout -- a gun, ammo, armor, another mod's construction robots -- is left
-- player-scoped, so every member still spawns with their own personal kit.
