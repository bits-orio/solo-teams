-- Compatibility with ClaustOrephobic (zzz-claustorephobic) by Braxbro
-- (https://mods.factorio.com/mod/zzz-claustorephobic). ClaustOrephobic covers
-- the world in banded ore via pure data-stage noise expressions, with an
-- ore-free clearing (~90 tiles at default settings) around each surface's
-- starting point. Because it is data-stage only, its worldgen and its
-- can't-build-on-ore collision layer apply to every team surface natively --
-- no chunk mirroring or runtime shims are needed.
--
-- What it does NOT guarantee near spawn, and what this module fixes:
--
--   • Crude oil. Oil is ineligible for ClaustOrephobic's banding (its patch
--     isn't AoE-minable), so it keeps its vanilla autoplace -- which never
--     places in the starting area. Teams would have to hike for their first
--     oil. We place one guaranteed crude-oil node at 300% yield, a set
--     distance out from spawn (mts_claust_oil_distance_tiles runtime
--     setting, default 64 tiles ~= 2 chunks).
--
--   • Water. ClaustOrephobic worlds are commonly rolled with water scaled
--     low/none to maximize the ore field. We place the same origin deepwater
--     hole the dangOreus compat uses, so an offshore pump always has a spot.
--
-- Each is placed from its own chunk's on_chunk_generated, AFTER clone_mirror,
-- so it survives the nauvis clone. The synced setting, constant amounts, and
-- a non-colliding search over identical terrain give every team's variant an
-- identical spawn kit (MTS's same-map-per-team goal) -- unless the admin
-- changes the distance between two teams' surface generations.

local claustorephobic = {}

-- The crude-oil node is targeted `d` tiles out from spawn on the same
-- diagonal as the water hole, where d is the admin-adjustable
-- mts_claust_oil_distance_tiles runtime setting (default 64 ~= 2 chunks:
-- clear of the base start, inside ClaustOrephobic's default ~90-tile ore
-- clearing). Read at chunk-gen time, so team surfaces generated after a
-- change use the new distance. Up to d ~180 the node's chunk falls within
-- MTS's radius-3 spawn pre-generation and exists before the player lands;
-- beyond that it appears when the team first explores that far.
--
-- Placement must keep the node (3x3 box included) inside its own chunk: it
-- is placed when THAT chunk generates, after clone_mirror has processed it,
-- and any part poking into a neighbouring chunk could be wiped by that
-- chunk's later clone pass. Hence the derived search radius and clamp below.
local OIL_YIELD_FACTOR  = 3    -- 300% of the prototype's normal (=100%) amount
local OIL_SEARCH_RADIUS = 13   -- max non-colliding search radius
local OIL_CHUNK_MARGIN  = 2.5  -- keeps the node's 3x3 box off the chunk border

--- Placement derived from the current setting: the tile target (equal x/y
--- putting the node ~d tiles from spawn), the chunk index containing it
--- (chunk (c,c)), and the search radius that keeps results inside that
--- chunk (may be < 1 when the target hugs a chunk border: skip searching).

--- Place one crude-oil node near `target` at OIL_YIELD_FACTOR richness.
--- find_non_colliding_position keeps it off water and off any resource
--- entity (water and resources both collide with the resource layer). When

--- border), force-place at the target clamped into the chunk's safe band --
--- keeping the guarantee, and keeping the node clone-safe.

--- containing its target (see oil_placement for pre-generation coverage).
--- VoidBlock islands are skipped: they're tiny with out-of-map beyond, and a
--- ClaustOrephobic+VoidBlock stack has no autoplaced ore to compensate for.
