-- Support for vanilla-style games (no Platformer mod) where each player
-- spawns on their own fresh copy of the Nauvis surface generated from the
-- same seed as the shared Nauvis, giving everyone an identical starting world.
--
-- Surface naming: "<force_name>-<planet>" e.g. "player-bob-nauvis"
-- Using force name (not player name/index) so the surface is identifiable
-- by its owning force, which supports multi-player teams in the future.
--
-- storage.player_surfaces[player_index] = {name = surface_name, planet = "nauvis"}

--- Create a personal Nauvis surface for `player` using the same map-gen
--- settings as the shared "nauvis" surface (same seed, fresh world state).
--- The surface will generate terrain identically to the original Nauvis but
--- is completely independent — only this player's force can see it.
---
--- Teleport is deferred to the next tick via storage.pending_vanilla_tp so
--- it is safe to call from on_player_created before the character is ready.
